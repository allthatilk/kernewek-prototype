# Introduction to Practical Modern Cornish

This course in Modern Cornish is designed to take the learner forward in
two stages, beginning with an introduction to the language in Part 1,
Foundations, where the basic vocabulary, speech patterns and rules are
taught, founded on practical, everyday words and phrases. On completion
of this part, the learner should be able to "survive" in everyday
situations in the home, and matters concerned with everyday living,
including family relationships, the home, food, drink, health, and so
on, yet also a few steps beyond the garden gate. The essential grammar
will now have been learn', and with the help of a dictionary this can be
built upon.

In part two, *Development*, knowledge of the language will be
consolidated and extended and the learner taken into the wider scene
outside of the home, into society, work, leisure, travel and the world,
with an ever wider vocabulary and increased skills in handling the
idiom, with more emphasis on style and the niceties of syntax. With both
parts assimilated students can extend themselves indefinitely and follow
their own preference, whether in social life or that of literature.

At all stages, the aim of *Practical Modern Cornish* is to become
familiar with and use the Vernacular Cornish Language, as spoken and
written by Cornish people during the period of *Modern Cornish.*

The vocabulary of *Modern Cornish* is already richer than that of any
other period of the history of the language, as it is the culmination of
continued assimilation and development from all ages, but there are
inevitable gaps when it comes to technical terms and new concepts that
have only come into use in any language sine the 18<sup>th</sup>
century. Many of these gaps can be filled by re-using already existing
words in new contexts, or combining them as phrases. Some words must be
taken directly from whatever other modern language can supply them,
which includes terms such as radio, television, rocket etc. This was
always the practice throughout the history of living Cornish, and one
adopted also by welsh, English, French, Spanish and all vital European
languages, the technical vocabulary of all these being largely composed
of words from neighbouring countries, and particularly from Latin and
Greek. Without this direct borrowing, languages would be greatly
impoverished. Nevertheless., there are a few words that can be
constructed from existing roots, but these are kept to a minimum.

The matter of orthography is perhaps, and surprisingly, the most
difficult to deal with. The only attempt to provide a systematic
spelling standard was made by Edward Lhuyd following his visit to
Cornwall in 1700, and while it was not generally accepted, it did
influence one or two later writers to some degree. nevertheless, it is
interesting that William Bodinar's letter written in 1776, shows no
influence from Lhuyd whatsoever, and is very much in keeping with the
best and most typical examples of Cornish from the previous century.

The orthography used by native writers prior to 1700 is, however, so
full of variations that for purposes of modern use it is essential to
standardise it., and this is done by choosing from existing examples
those that are either commonest or most representative of the character
and sounds of the language, while at the same time retaining a degree of
dignity.

The writers drawn upon as exemplars are William Rowe of Sancreed, and
Nicholas and Thomas Boson of Newlyn, with some useful ideas taken from
Edward Lhuyd and a few other contemporaries.

# Pronunciation from vowel letters and combinations

The pronunciation of the vowels is best explained by considering how
these are represented through the combination of letters. Figures
included below refer to the [vowel
codes](pronounce/vowels.php "Vowel codes") . A hyphen indicates an
unstressed termination. Ex.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">-ack.</span>

## Meeting, greeting, saying goodbye

Before we get down to learning Cornish we need to be able to greet one
and other in the language, invite each other in, use a few sociable
phrases and say goodbye. Study the phrases and when you are comfortable
with them compose two or three short scenes by rearranging the material
in as many ways as you can as simple dialogues between two people. Act
them out with a friend if you can.

When meeting someone whose name you know, which might be in the street,
at a get-together, or even answering the door say:
<span class="cornish">[Ha](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Ha&submit=single "Hello")</span>
...Followed by the persons
name.

<span class="cornish">[Ha](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Ha&submit=single "Hello")
Jooan\!</span>

</div>

Hello John\! or Hi John\!

Other ways of greeting without using a person's name
are...

<span class="cornish">[Ha](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Ha&submit=single "Hello")
[soas\!](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=soas&submit=single "comrade")</span>

Hello boy\! or Hello girl\! literally hello
comrade.

<span class="cornish">[Ha,](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Ha&submit=single "Hello")
[cheel](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=cheel&submit=single "child")
[vian\!](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=vian&submit=single "little")</span>

Hello, my dear (to male or female, old or young, literally little
child)

<span class="cornish">[Metten](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Metten&submit=single "morning")
[daa\!](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=daa&submit=single "good") (the
[why\!)](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=why&submit=single "you")</span>

Good morning\! (to
you\!)

<span class="cornish">[Durdatha](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Durdatha&submit=single "good day")
[why\!](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=why&submit=single "you")</span>

Good day to
you\!

<span class="cornish">[Lowena](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Lowena&submit=single "joy")
[thew\!](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=thew&submit=single "you")</span>

Joy to you\!

The next stage is to show some interest in the person you have
met...

<span class="cornish">[Looan](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Looan&submit=single "happy")
o [ve](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=ve&submit=single "me")
[tho](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=tho&submit=single "was, he")

[gwellaz](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=gwellaz&submit=single "see")
[why.](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=why&submit=single "you")</span>

I'm glad to see
you.

I'm glad to see you you are in good health.

You may wish to ask after his or her health...

## Naming what you see, a, the and gender

<span class="cornish">[Pandreu](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Pandreu&submit=single "what")
[hebma?](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=hebma&submit=single "this")</span>
or
<span class="cornish">[Dreu](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Dreu&submit=single "that it is")
[hebma?](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=hebma&submit=single "this")</span>

</div>

What is
this?

<span class="cornish">[Pandreu](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Pandreu&submit=single "what")
[hedda?](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=hedda&submit=single "that")</span>
or
<span class="cornish">[Dreu](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Dreu&submit=single "that it is")
[hedda?](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=hedda&submit=single "that")</span>

What is
that?

<span class="cornish">[Cathe](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Cathe&submit=single "cat")
[eu](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=eu&submit=single "is")</span>

It is a cat.

In Cornish there is no word for "a". Hence "a cat" is translated as
"cathe" and the word "a" is not translated. notice also that here "eu"
means "it is" and the word "it" is not translated. Elsewhere you will
find that it simply means "is".

## Gender

Every Cornish noun must belong to one of two genders, masculine...
<span class="cornish">guraw</span> or feminine
<span class="cornish">benaw.</span> If we arrange guraw to the left and
benaw to the right it will help you remember which gender applies. It is
important to know the gender of each word for several reasons. Here is
the first:.

## The definite article

the =
<span class="cornish">[an](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=an&submit=single "the")</span>
(A may also be used, specially before a v- ). If an/a is placed before a
feminine word beginning with any of the letters shown below the first
letter of the word must be *softened.* The list of words used is
arranged with <span class="cornish">guraw</span> to the left and
<span class="cornish">benaw</span> to the right. You will see how an/a
does not affect the <span class="cornish">guraw</span> words, but does
affect the <span class="cornish">benaw</span> words. This is called
mutation.

Adjectives are usually placed after the noun they describe (but see
list). So
<span class="cornish">[Dean](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Dean&submit=single "man")
[younk](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=younk&submit=single "young")</span>
*a young man.* If an adjective begins with any of the letters listed in
the diagram in [lesson 2](lesson2/page1.php) and it follows a *feminine*
noun, then its first letter must be softened that applied to "an + a
feminine
noun".

*\* We use
<span class="cornish">[wedn](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=wedn&submit=single "white")</span>
the feminine form only if directly following the noun.*  

If the subject were
<span class="cornish">[ky](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=ky&submit=single "dog")</span>,
dog, which is masculine, then
<span class="cornish">[hy](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=hy&submit=single "she")</span>,
she, would be replaced by
<span class="cornish">[ea](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=ea&submit=single "he")</span>,
he, and the above phrase would
become:

If two things are in close relationship, including in matters of
ownership, simply place them together, subject first. This also
translates the English

    Jooan</span> - John's
    house.

#### The pseudo possesive adjective (my, your etc.)

The pseudo possesive adjective can also be expressed in this way by
adding pronouns to what is possessed. After introducing by adding *an/a*
(the), although in practice this may be omitted. So:

    - their
    father.
  - <span class="cornish">[looar](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=looar&submit=single "garden")

# Deskanz Pemp - 5

## Location and possession

In
<span class="cornish">[deskanz](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=deskanz&submit=single "lesson")</span>4
you saw how to use the present descriptive tense of
<span class="cornish">[boaz](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=boaz&submit=single "to be")</span>,
*to be*. If we are talking of *where things are* or *what is being
done*, a different tense is used. So:

This is about
<span class="cornish">[cathe](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=cathe&submit=single "cat")</span>,
a cat, and
<span class="cornish">[kistan](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=kistan&submit=single "box")</span>,
a box. Both are <span class="cornish">benaw</span>
(feminine).

[ennah](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=ennah&submit=single "there")

and there is a box (Note: ennah = there or there is, there
are)

<span class="cornish">[Peleah](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=Peleah&submit=single "where")
[ma](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=ma&submit=single "my, this")

## The true possessive adjective

In [lesson 4](lesson4/page1.php#pseudo) you learn't how to express *my,
his, her, etc*. As a pseudo possessive adjective by simply adding
<span class="cornish">[ve,](scripts/dictionary.php?cword=ve&submit=single "me")
e hei</span>, etc. The true possessive adjective is just as common and
in places must be used in preference. It supplies a separate word for
each person and each word except fro the 1<sup>st</sup> & 2<sup>nd</sup>
persons plural cause certain modifications in the spelling of a
following word (the thing or person possessed). As follows:

Kernooack

</div>

Sousnack

 

a<sup>3</sup>, ma<sup>3</sup>

my

All are numbered <sup>3</sup> and cause the same aspirate mutation of C
& K as shown in the numerals section under 3

ago<sup>3</sup>, go<sup>3</sup>, o<sup>3</sup>

their

e<sup>3</sup>

her, its

e<sup>2</sup>

his, its

Softens letters as shown in [lesson 2](lesson2/page1.php#mutations)

agon, gon

our

These do not cause any chabges

agoz, goz, oz

your

Any variation shown may be used. The shorter forms being preferred
generally, but those beginning with a vowel must be used following a
consonant. NB *o* is obscure throughout.

#### Note 1:

*en* (the) becomes *et* before all vowel forms. So:

|              |                       |
| :----------- | :-------------------- |
| et a         | in my (but en ma, id) |
| et a         | in his, her, its      |
| et agon      | in our                |
| et agoz / oz | in your               |
| et ago / o   | in their              |

#### Note 2:

*en* also translates (in the). This is sometimes found as *et an* in
literature after 1700, but in part 1 we will keep to the first version.

## Numerals when counting

When counting rapidly, as when couting sheep, fish, etc., there are two
methods:

1.  Count repeatedly *un, deaw, try, padgar, pemp*. Keeping a tally,
    either mentally or on your fingers etc and then mutliply. Thus 100
    would be arrived at by repeating 1-5 twenty times, or 5 x 20.
2.  Do as before, but consider each number as five time sgreater. This
    is used fro counting smaller fish, coins or whatever can
    conveniently be held in the hand. In this way 100 would simply be
    twenty handfuls or 1(=5) x 20

#### Numerals 1 - 4
